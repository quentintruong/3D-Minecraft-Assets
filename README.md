# 3D-Minecraft-Assets
Everything is UV-mapped and built for Blender Cycles. 

Some objects, like the characters, chicken, and chests are rigged and some have shape keys for facial movement. 

The fire is a four-object-particle-system; if you want it to last longer, extend both the number of emission objects and the length of time. The fire particle system is a continuous series loop.

You may have to manually reconect images to their respective objects, depending on where you place the files.

Free for any use without credit, but a star on this github would be deeply appreciated :P
